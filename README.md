PrincessEdit2
=============

A level editor for 'Nova the Squirrel 2' though it's generic enough that you could probably use it for other games if you want. It's designed for games whose levels are a series of rectangles of different sizes and materials.

Dependencies
--------------
- [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/), plus [image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) and [ttf](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/)
- cJSON, included in the repository

With the SDL2 and its companion libraries installed, you should be able to just use `make`
